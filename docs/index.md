# Welcome to Argussight

`Argussight` is a versatile video processing tool designed to manage and run multiple streaming processes using one or several input sources. It primarily works with FFmpeg streams, ensuring high compatibility and performance for video processing tasks.

Originally developed as an extension of the [video-streamer](https://github.com/mxcube/video-streamer) project by the [MXCuBE](https://github.com/mxcube) organization, `Argussight` can also operate as a standalone application. Its flexible design allows it to be reconfigured for integration with other components, making it adaptable to various use cases.

## Why Choose Argussight?
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Multiple streams could be displayed at once from the same source, providing a comprehensive view from different angles and/or sources.

- **Facilitates Usage of Computer Vision Algorithms**: Developers can make use of different computer vision algorithms, directly on the images and do not need to handle the complexity of handling video-loading or streaming.

- **On-the-Fly Configuration**: The system can dynamically adjust streams, such as changing parameters for video anlaysis, change position of region of interest or simply switching between views according to user preferences, withou needing to restart or reconfigure the entire process.
